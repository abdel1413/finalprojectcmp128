              <p><span id="hi">Hi</span>, Iâ€™m Aboulaye, a fresman computer science student 
                at Lehman College of the City
                University of New York. I don't have enough  experience with HTML and
                CSS yet thanks to online videos I am watching in 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=html+tutorial+for+beginners">youtube</a> 
                and of course, I am practicing many things in our famouse 
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3school </a>.I can manage  to 
                get something display on websiteNow,I am taking
                <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sfulakeza/">CMP 128</a> 
                because I lovecreating websites  and pushing them online 
                so It is for me a wise choice to take this course 
                in order to build a strong basic skills. As, former 
                President M.Obama said, "everyone should learn programming" 
                since it involves thinking a lot to solve any problem.<br>

              <p class="firstp">This is the first annual Cloud Computing 
                Conference at Lehman College. 
                The conference series will feature keynote talks, special sessions,
                 poster presentation, tutorials, workshops, and contributed papers.
              </p>

              <p class="secondp">The goal of the conference is to be a premier 
                  venue for 
                researchers and industry practitioners to share new ideas, 
                research results and development 
                experiences in various fields. This will be one of a kind 
                in the Bronx.

              <p class="thirdp">Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand 
                computing 
                services, from applications to storage and processing
                 power. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources 
                 to achieve coherence and economies of scale. Advocates 
                 of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing
                  allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT 
                  infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud 
                  computing allows enterprises to get their applications 
                  up and running faster, with improved manageability and 
                  less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more 
                  rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and 
                  unpredictable demand, providing the burst computing 
                  capability: high computing power at certain periods 
                  of peak demand.
